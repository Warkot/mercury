## Manual Setup
* `npm run setup` will install all dependencies, including node modules and bower components
* Adjust `server/config/localSettings.js` and override the defaults if needed, more in [localSettings](#localSettings)
* `npm run dev` will start the server and watch files

## localSettings
`localSettings` is main configuration structure. All application settings should be stored there.
Config files are loaded in the following order (next extending a previous one):
 * `localSettings.base.js` - configuration for production environment - used on production, testing and staging
 * `localSettings.dev.js` - configuration for development environment - used on devboxes
 * `localSettings.js` - your local overrides
 
Some tips if you develop outside of devbox:
 * The devboxDomain must have your devbox name (without the dev- prefix) in it
 * If you want to test with consul, use `mediawikiDomain: 'consul.service.sjc-dev.consul'` or `mediawikiDomain: 'consul.service.poz-dev.consul'`

## Access Mercury
### Devbox environment
Open http://muppet.yourname.wikia-dev.com/wiki/Kermit from mobile device or while emulating it in desktop browser.
Or use `curl -H "Host:muppet.yourname.wikia-dev.com" "http://dev-yourname:7000/wiki/Kermit"`

### Local environment
Open http://muppet.127.0.0.1.xip.io:7000/wiki/Kermit

## [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Wikia/mercury/blob/dev/CHANGELOG.md)

## Unit tests
To run the unit tests run `npm test` in your terminal.

## Updating translations
Localization is handled by [i18next](http://i18next.com/) JavaScript library and [CrowdIn](https://crowdin.com/) service. i18next is a part (module) of the Mercury and loads files from `front/common/public/locales` directory. CrowdIn is an external service which is responsible only for providing translations for the keys' values from the source file `front/common/public/locales/en/<namespace>.json`. Wikia has its own CrowdIn client which is already installed on your dev-box.

### Uploading new keys/updating key values in the source file
If during the development process you've added new keys to the `front/common/public/locales/en/<namespace>.json` file (the source file), then you have to upload it to CrowdIn to enable the translators to work on the other languages. The same applies if you've changed the values of the existing keys in the source file, as the corresponding values in other languages are being invalidated.
* go to your dev-box and clone the Mercury project (or just upload the `crowdin.conf` file, but this approach needs more flirting with the configuration, manual updating and command line switches â†’ not recommended)
* checkout the branch with the desired changes (or just upload the new source file)
* from the project root directory run `crowdin upload`

### Checking the translation status
* from the project root directory run `crowdin translation-status`
* you can also go to [the project's web page](https://crowdin.com/project/mercury) (more info on access on [Internal](https://one.wikia-inc.com/wiki/Crowdin))

### Downloading the translations
* to simply pull the localization files run `crowdin download` from the project's root directory
* be aware that you can use command line switches, few of them control git:
    * `-c` checkout a new branch with a default name and commit the changes (recommended)
    * `-b` change the default branch name (which is set to `i18n-update` in [`crowdin/main.conf`](https://github.com/Wikia/mercury/blob/dev/crowdin/main.conf#L3))
    * `-m` add a message to the commit
    * `-p` push the branch to GitHub

More details can be found in `README.rst` in [the i18n-tools repository](https://github.com/Wikia/i18n-tools).

If the translations are downloaded and ready, you can merge in `dev` to the `i18n-update` branch (or however you've named it), take a look at the outcome, fix bugs/conflicts if any and issue a pull request.

## Testing on devices when developing locally
### Using IP over the same network
To test on your mobile device, connect both your development machine and your device to the same network. You can then visit Mercury on your device by using your machine's IP address (on OS X, you can get that using `ifconfig`). The URL should look something like: `//muppet.10.10.10.123.xip.io:8000/wiki/Foo`.

## Troubleshooting
### Errors while running `npm install`
#### Debian and its nodejs binary
Debian (the issue was found on version: `Debian 3.16.7-ckt4-3 (2015-02-03)`) installs node.js interpreter binary as `nodejs` instead of `node` because of name conflicts with other applications. The `/usr/share/doc/nodejs/README.Debian` reads:
> nodejs command
> --------------
>
> The upstream name for the Node.js interpreter command is "node".
> In Debian the interpreter command has been changed to "nodejs".
>
> This was done to prevent a namespace collision: other commands use the same name in their upstreams, such as ax25-node from the "node" package.
>
> Scripts calling Node.js as a shell command must be changed to instead use the "nodejs" command.
However, changing dependencies scripts does not sound right way. @nandy-andy suggests creating a symlink in `/usr/bin`:
```sh
sudo ln -s /usr/bin/nodejs /usr/bin/node
$ ls /usr/bin/ | grep node
node
node-gyp
nodejs
```
